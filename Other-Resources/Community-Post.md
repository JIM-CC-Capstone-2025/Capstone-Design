# SOC Testing — JIM Telecom Honeypot

Hey folks!

For my cybersecurity capstone project, my team and I have created a simulated telecommunications company called JIM Telecom. As part of this project, we’ve built a deliberately vulnerable web application and backend infrastructure designed to mimic a small telecom business environment.

### 🎯 Purpose:
We're using a SOC environment we've developed to analyze attacker behavior, TTPs, and lateral movement patterns in a controlled, legal setting. Our goal is to generate information on the effectiveness of honeypots, as well as the patterns of attack within telecommunication infrastructure. 

### 🔒 Ethical Notice:

This is a safe testing environment we fully own.

No sensitive data, customer records, or production systems are involved.

All activity is logged and monitored for research and educational use only.

### 🌐 Want to poke around?
We’d love for anyone in the cybersecurity community to interact with the site — whether you're a red teamer, pentester, or just curious. You're welcome to scan, explore, break, and test our environment using whatever techniques you deem fit.

We’d also appreciate any feedback on how we could make it a better educational experience (or juicier for attackers 👀).

Thanks in advance — and stay safe out there!
